        <h1>Happy Birthday, Poet! âœ¨</h1>
        <p>Heyy, you made it here! First of all, a *huge* Happy Birthday, Ankita! ðŸŽ‰</p>
        <p>Finally 18! A whole new chapter, and I know you're going to make it amazing. So, tell me, how does it feel? Pretty great, right?</p>
        <p>From the day we met, I knew you were *one of a kind*. Youâ€™re the kind of person who sprinkles magic wherever you goâ€”whether itâ€™s through your words, your kindness, or just by being you.</p>
        <p>This little puzzle journey was my way of making your day a bit more special, but honestly, no words or gifts could ever match how much you mean to me.</p>
        <p>You deserve *all the happiness in the world*, and I hope this year brings you love, laughter, and dreams coming true.</p>
        <p>Keep shining, keep dreaming, and keep being the *incredible poet* that you are! âœ¨</p>
        <p>â€” With all my heart, your best friend. ðŸ’™</p>
